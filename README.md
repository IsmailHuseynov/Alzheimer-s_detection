# Early detection of Alzheimer’s disease: Deep Learning approach

With the aim of improving the early detection of Alzheimer’s disease, this article focuses on the use of advanced algorithms, such as Deep Learning, to analyse large amounts of image data. To achieve this goal, the article proposes using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which is a type of Deep Learning algorithm that excels in image analysis. By training a CNN on a large dataset of medical images, the model can learn to automatically identify patterns and features that are indicative of Alzheimer’s disease. The ultimate goal is to develop a web application that can detect Alzheimer’s disease in its early stages with high accuracy.
